Hi! My name is Ankit and I'm a PhD student at ETH Zuerich. I am a Materials Scientist by training and my research focuses on using quantum-mechanical simulations together with high-performance computing and data analytics to investigate the magnetic properties of materials. In my free time, I love to write about the 
    projects I have worked on and this blog is dedicated to the same. I hope you enjoy reading!
